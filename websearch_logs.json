The NPCI then ensures that the data flow between the banks and the payment apps is routed correctly.\n\n# UPI Transaction Flow\n\nNow that we have gone through the basics of UPI and how it works, you must be thinking about what the payment flow looks like with multiple stakeholders involved at various levels. Let\u2019s look at the various steps involved in UPI payments: [...] UPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is a digital payment system in India that allows instant money transfer between bank accounts through a mobile platform. It works by linking your bank account to a UPI-enabled app, like BHIM, Google Pay, or Paytm. Once linked, you can make or receive payments using a UPI ID or QR code. Transactions are completed in real-time, and you only need the recipient\u2019s UPI ID, avoiding the need to share bank account details. UPI is known for its ease of use, speed, and",

For example, by integrating dependency trees into a GCN, structure information can be captured while simultaneously learning node and edge features, effectively handling overlapping or complex relation labels . Furthermore, various methods have been employed, such as combining BERT-based NER with translation-based frameworks like TransE for accurate extraction from domain datasets [...] In the Pre-Construction Preparation phase, the focus is on laying a robust foundation for KG construction through two key steps. First, Named Entity Recognition employs advanced techniques such as BERT-based models, Bi-LSTM, CRF, and graph-based methods to accurately identify key entities and map them to predefined ontologies [5,6,7,8,9,10].

As AI models, especially those in the domain of natural language processing and computer vision, generate and work with these vectors, the need for efficient storage and retrieval systems has become paramount. This is where vector databases come into play, providing a highly optimized environment for these AI-driven applications. [...] While regular databases search for exact data matches, vector databases look for the closest match using specific measures of similarity.\n\nVector databases use special search techniques known as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, which includes methods like hashing and graph-based searches.\n\nTo really understand how vector databases work and how it is different from traditional relational databases like SQL, we have to first understand the concept of embeddings. [...] Vector databases, with their unique capabilities, are carving out niches in a multitude of industries due to their efficiency in implementing \"similarity search.\" Here's a deeper dive into their diverse applications:\n\n### 1.

These architectures bring together perception, reasoning, and action, allowing systems to work independently and improve by learning from experience.

[...] The concept emerged from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\u2019s literary works, but Sigmund Freud transformed our understanding of masochistic character through his groundbreaking psychoanalytic theory. Freud identified moral masochism as a pattern where individuals unconsciously seek suffering through self-punishment and self-sabotage, distinct from sexual masochism. Later psychoanalytic thinkers expanded on these ideas to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how these patterns form and persist.
